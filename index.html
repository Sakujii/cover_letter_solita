            Dear Solitans,
            </p>
            <p>
            I am applying for Solita Data Academy for the second time now. On the first try I gained some experience about the recruitment process and realised there were some gaps in my knowledge and experience.
            I was still very motivated, so I started to study <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-engineering/">Data Engineering</a> on a learning platform called Dataquest. 
            I completed several SQL and Python related courses (links to specific courses can be found on my <a href="https://sakujii.github.io/cvsite/">CV</a>) and gained quite a lot of knowledge as well as revised many things I already knew.
            On top of that, I have been learning a lot more about Power BI and also took my first steps into Azure services. I have finished a few data-related projects, which are public on my Github.
            
            </p>
            <p>
            In the latter part of my studies life took me to an exciting direction, and I have been living abroad for a few years now. 
            I was always interested in my field of studies, namely energy engineering, but did not find a satisfying enough job here in Poland, so I started working as a freelance translator. 
            The freedom of freelancer life is great, and I have been enjoying it to the fullest. 
            That being said, now I am ready to move back to Finland in the search for something more technical and challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since my first engineering summer job, I have always been working with data. 
            Most of the time the tool in use was Excel, and I know that still there are a lot of businesses relying on Excel for data analysis and even data management. 
            It is undeniably a great universal tool, but already about five years back I saw the problems in business with everything relying on Excel worksheets.
            I always had a hunger to learn and use better tools for data management and visualisation, but yet I have not had the opportunity to do it professionally.
            I enjoy making visualisations and dashboards for real-life use, so maybe a mixture of the Data Engineer and Data Visualisation Consultant paths could be the most suitable for me.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a person I am relaxed and co-operative. On the other hand I am a bit of a perfectionist, but I also know how to compromise. 
            I always finish what I have promised and can be relied on. Solita Data Academy feels like a perfect opportunity for me.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking forward to hearing from you,
            </p>
