            Dear Solitans,
            </p>
            <p>
            I have been eyeing on this opportunity since I graduated, and now it was my time to apply for the Solita Data Academy. Here comes a bit about my background. In the latter part of my studies and after my graduation, life took me to another direction, and I’ve been living abroad for a few years now. I was always interested in my own field of studies, namely energy engineering, but I did not find a satisfying enough job here in Poland, so I started working as a freelance translator! The freedom of freelancer life is great and I have been enjoying it by traveling as much as I could during these few not so easy years for crossing borders. Now I am ready to move back to Finland in the search for something more technical and challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since my first engineering summer job I have been always working with data. Mostly the tool in use was Excel, and I know that still there are a lot of industries and energy companies in Finland relying on Excel for data analysis and even data management. It is undeniably a great universal tool, but already about five years back I saw the problem with Excel reports in different servers getting messed up when different people were using or working on them. I always had a hunger to learn and use better tools for data management and visualization, but yet I haven’t had the opportunity to do it professionally. During the last couple of years, I have been lightly studying about Pandas Dataframes and similar subjects. I feel that anything more complicated is hard to learn without real world data and a real need behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my previous jobs and studies, I always enjoyed making different visualizations and even built a couple of dashboards for real-life use, of course again in Excel. In my opinion tools like Power BI and Tableau are quite intuitive and rather similar to Excel pivot tables and graphs, thus I have some applicable experience for this path. On the other hand, during my studies I got very interested in programming, and acquired decent skills in Python and C++, so maybe we could find a mixture of the Data Engineer and Data Visualization Specialist paths most suitable for me.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a person I am relaxed and co-operative. Sometimes I might be a bit of a perfectionist, but I also know how to compromise. I always finish what I’ve promised and can be relied on. Solita Data Academy feels like a perfect occasion for me right now.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking forward to hearing from you,
            </p>
