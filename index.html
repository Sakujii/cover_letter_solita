            Dear Solitans,
            </p>
            <p>
            I have been eyeing on this opportunity since I graduated from Tampere University, and now it was my time to apply for the Solita Data Academy. Here comes a bit about my background and motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the latter part of my studies life took me to an exciting direction, and I have been living abroad for a few years now. I was always interested in my own field of studies, namely energy engineering, but I did not find a satisfying enough job here in Poland, so I started working as a freelance translator. The freedom of freelancer life is great and I have been enjoying it to the fullest. That being said, now I am ready to move back to Finland in the search for something more technical and challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since my first engineering summer job I have been always working with data. Most of the times the tool in use was Excel, and I know that still there are a lot of businesess relying on Excel for data analysis and even data management. It is undeniably a great universal tool, but already about five years back I saw the problem with Excel reports stored in servers getting messed up when different people were using or working on them. I always had a hunger to learn and use better tools for data management and visualisation, but yet I have not had the opportunity to do it professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my previous jobs and studies, I always enjoyed making different visualisations and even built a couple of dashboards for real-life use, of course again in Excel. In my opinion tools like Power BI and Tableau are quite intuitive and rather similar to Excel pivot tables and graphs, thus I have some applicable experience for this path. On the other hand, during my university studies I got very interested in programming, and acquired decent skills in Python and C++, as well as the basics of SQL, so maybe we could find a mixture of the Data Engineer and Data Visualisation Consultant paths most suitable for me.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a person I am relaxed and co-operative. On the other hand I am a bit of a perfectionist, but I also know how to compromise. I always finish what I have promised and can be relied on. Solita Data Academy feels like a perfect opportunity for me right now.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking forward to hearing from you,
            </p>
